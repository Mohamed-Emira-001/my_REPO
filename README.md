# 👋 Hello There #

Welcome to my personal DevOps notes and practice repository!  
I'm **Emira**, and this space is dedicated to documenting commands, tools, tips, and everything I learn along my DevOps journey 🚀

This repository includes:
- 🐧 Linux commands
- 🐳 Docker usage
- ☸️ Kubernetes basics
- ⚙️ DevOps tools and workflows
- 📋 Practical examples and guides

I created this repo as a personal reference and learning tool — and if you find it useful too, that’s a win! 🙌
