# Git Instructions: SSH Setup & Remote Repo Workflow

---

## Generate SSH Keys & Connect to GitHub

```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen

# Add your public key (~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) to GitHub:
# GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key

# Test the connection to GitHub
ssh -T git@github.com

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

# Verify your config
git config --list

# For HTTPS:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

# For SSH:
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo.git

# For HTTPS:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

# For SSH:
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo.git

# Pull from Remote
git pull

###Note###
when i push remotely from master to master >>> There is no pull request needed because GitHub sees it as a fast-forward update — no code review or merging between branches is required
>>Pull Requests Only Happen When:
	You create a new branch (e.g. feature-x)
	Push it to GitHub
	Then open a pull request to merge it into master (or main)
